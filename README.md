# OpenDyslexic Font Resourcepack for Minecraft 1.17

A simple resourcepack that replaces the default Minecraft font with a dyslexic font provided by OpenDyslexic that is said to help people with dyslexia. While i'm not dyslexic myself, making this resourcepack may still help people and allow them to play the game in a way that's comfortable for them.
